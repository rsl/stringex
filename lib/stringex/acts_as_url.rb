    module ActsAsUrlClassMethods # :doc:
      # Creates a callback to automatically create an url-friendly representation
      # of the <tt>attribute</tt> argument. Example:
      #
      #   acts_as_url :title
      #
      # will use the string contents of the <tt>title</tt> attribute
      # to create the permalink. <strong>Note:</strong> you can also use a non-database-backed
      # method to supply the string contents for the permalink. Just use that method's name
      # as the argument as you would an attribute.
      #
      # The default attribute <tt>acts_as_url</tt> uses to save the permalink is <tt>url</tt>
      # but this can be changed in the options hash. Available options are:
      #
      # <tt>:adapter</tt>:: If specified, will indicate what ORM adapter to use. Default functionality
      #                     is to use the first available adapter. This should work for most cases
      #                     unless you are using multiple ORMs in a single project.
      # <tt>:allow_slash</tt>:: If true, allows the generated url to contain slashes. Default is false[y].
      # <tt>:allow_duplicates</tt>:: If true, allows duplicate urls instead of appending numbers to
      #                              differentiate between urls. Default is false[y]. See note on <tt>:scope</tt>.
      # <tt>:duplicate_count_separator</tt>:: String to use when forcing unique urls from non-unique strings.
      #                                       Default is "-".
      # <tt>:duplicate_sequence</tt>:: Supply an enumerator to generate the values used to generate
      #                                unique urls (when <tt>:allow_duplicates</tt> is false).
      #                                By default, generates positive integers in sequence from 1.
      #                                <strong>Note:</strong> The sequence is restarted for each record
      #                                (by calling <tt>#rewind</tt>).
      # <tt>:force_downcase</tt>:: If false, allows generated url to contain uppercased letters. Default is false.
      # <tt>:exclude_list</tt>:: List of complete strings that should not be transformed by <tt>acts_as_url</tt>.
      #                          Default is empty.
      # <tt>:only_when_blank</tt>:: If true, the url generation will only happen when <tt>:url_attribute</tt> is
      #                             blank. Default is false[y] (meaning url generation will happen always).
      # <tt>:scope</tt>:: The name of model attribute to scope unique urls to. There is no default here.
      #                   <strong>Note:</strong> this will automatically act as if <tt>:allow_duplicates</tt>
      #                   is set to true.
      # <tt>:sync_url</tt>:: If set to true, the url field will be updated when changes are made to the
      #                      attribute it is based on. Default is false.
      # <tt>:url_attribute</tt>:: The name of the attribute to use for storing the generated url string.
      #                           Default is <tt>:url</tt>.
      # <tt>:limit</tt>:: The maximum size a generated url should be. <strong>Note:</strong> this does not
      #                   include the characters needed to enforce uniqueness on duplicate urls.
      #                   Default is nil.
