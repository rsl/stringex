Some [hopefully] useful extensions to Ruby's String class. It is made up of three libraries: ActsAsUrl, Unidecoder, and StringExtensions.

<em>NOTE: Stringex 2.0 [and beyond] drops support for Rails 2. If you need support for that version, use 1.5.1 instead.</em>

== ActsAsUrl

<em>NOTE: You can now require 'stringex_lite' instead of 'stringex' and skip loading ActsAsUrl functionality if you don't need it.</em>

This library is designed to create URI-friendly representations of an attribute, for use in generating urls from your attributes. Basic usage is just calling the method:

  # Inside your model
  acts_as_url :title

which will populate the <tt>url</tt> attribute on the object with the converted contents of the <tt>title</tt> attribute. This behavior can be customized by adding the following options to the arguments of the <tt>acts_as_url</tt> method:

<tt>:url_attribute</tt>:: The name of the attribute to use for storing the generated url string.
                          Default is <tt>:url</tt>
<tt>:scope</tt>:: The name of model attribute to scope unique urls to. There is no default here.
<tt>:only_when_blank</tt>:: If set to true, the url generation will only happen when <tt>:url_attribute</tt> is
                            blank. Default is false (meaning url generation will happen always).
<tt>:sync_url</tt>:: If set to true, the url field will be updated when changes are made to the
                     attribute it is based on. Default is false.
<tt>:allow_slash</tt>:: If set to true, the url field will not convert slashes. Default is false.
<tt>:allow_duplicates</tt>:: If set to true, unique urls will not be enforced.
                             Default is false. <em>NOTE: This is strongly not recommended
                             if you are routing solely on the generated slug as you will no longer
                             be guaranteed to lookup the expected record based on a duplicate slug.</em>
<tt>:limit</tt>:: If set, will limit length of url generated. Default is nil.

In order to use the generated url attribute, you will probably want to override <tt>to_param</tt> like so, in your Model:

  # Inside your model
  def to_param
    url # or whatever you set :url_attribute to
  end

Routing called via named routes like <tt>foo_path(@foo)</tt> will automatically use the url. In your controllers you will need to call <tt>Foo.find_by_url(params[:id])</tt> instead of the regular find. Don't look for <tt>params[:url]</tt> unless you set it explicitly in the routing, <tt>to_param</tt> will generate <tt>params[:id]</tt>.

Note that if you add <tt>acts_as_url</tt> to an existing model, the <tt>url</tt> database column will initially be blank. To set this column for your existing instances, you can use the <tt>initialize_urls</tt> method. So if your class is <tt>Post</tt>, just say <tt>Post.initialize_urls</tt>.

Unlike other permalink solutions, ActsAsUrl doesn't rely on Iconv (which is inconsistent across platforms and doesn't provide great transliteration as is) but instead uses a transliteration scheme (see the code for Unidecoder) which produces much better results for Unicode characters. It also mixes in some custom helpers to translate common characters into a more URI-friendly format rather than just dump them completely. Examples:

   # A simple prelude
   "simple English".to_url => "simple-english"
   "it's nothing at all".to_url => "its-nothing-at-all"
   "rock & roll".to_url => "rock-and-roll"

   # Let's show off
   "$12 worth of Ruby power".to_url => "12-dollars-worth-of-ruby-power"
   "10% off if you act now".to_url => "10-percent-off-if-you-act-now"

   # You don't even wanna trust Iconv for this next part
   "kick it en Français".to_url => "kick-it-en-francais"
   "rock it Español style".to_url => "rock-it-espanol-style"
   "tell your readers 你好".to_url => "tell-your-readers-ni-hao"

Compare those results with the ones produced on my Intel Mac by a leading permalink plugin:

  "simple English" # => "simple-english"
  "it's nothing at all" # => "it-s-nothing-at-all"
  "rock & roll" # => "rock-roll"

  "$12 worth of Ruby power" # => "12-worth-of-ruby-power"
  "10% off if you act now" # => "10-off-if-you-act-now"

  "kick it en Français" # => "kick-it-en-francais"
  "rock it Español style" # => "rock-it-espan-ol-style"
  "tell your readers 你好" # => "tell-your-readers"

Not so great, actually.

Note: No offense is intended to the author[s] of whatever plugins might produce such results. It's not your faults Iconv sucks.

== Unidecoder

This library converts Unicode [and accented ASCII] characters to their plain-text ASCII equivalents. This is a port of Perl's Unidecode and provides eminently superior and more reliable results than Iconv. (Seriously, Iconv... A plague on both your houses! [sic])

You probably won't ever need to run Unidecoder by itself. StringExtensions adds String#to_ascii which wraps all of Unidecoder's functionality. For anyone interested, details of the implementation can be read about in the original implementation of Text::Unidecode[http://interglacial.com/~sburke/tpj/as_html/tpj22.html]. Extensive examples can be found in the tests.

Unidecoder module also provides localization options for Stringex. You can use this functionality by loading either a YAML file or Hash like the following code snippets:

  # Using a Hash
  Stringex.localize_from :en => {"é" => "ee"}

  # Loading from a file. NOTE: The path to file should be absolute.
  Stringex.localize_from "/path/to/yaml_file"

In both the YAML and pure Hash implementation, the end result should be a Hash with keys representing the locale and values being another Hash with those keys being the UTF character and the values the transliterated ASCII values. (I hope that made sense.) You can check the documentation for the Unidecoder module for more information about setting locales.

== StringExtensions

A small collection of extensions on Ruby's String class. Please see the documentation for StringExtensions module for more information. There's not much to explain about them really.

== Localization

With Stringex version 2.0 and higher, you can localize the different conversions in Stringex. Read more here[https://github.com/rsl/stringex/wiki/Localization-of-Stringex-conversions]. If you add a new language, please submit a pull request so we can make it available to other users also.

== Ruby on Rails Usage

When using Stringex with Ruby on Rails, you automatically get built-in translations for miscellaneous characters, HTML entities, and vulgar fractions. You can see Stringex's standard translations here[https://github.com/rsl/stringex/tree/master/locales].

Currently, built-in translations are available for the following languages:

  * English (en)
  * Danish (da)
  * Dutch (nl)
  * German (de)
  * Portuguese Brazilian (pt-BR)
  * Russian (ru)


You can easily add your own or customize the built-in translations - read here[https://github.com/rsl/stringex/wiki/Localization-of-Stringex-conversions]. If you add a new language, please submit a pull request so we can make it available to other users also.

If you don't want to use the Stringex built-in translations, you can force Stringex to use English (or another language), regardless what is in your +I18n.locale+. In an initializer, e.g. +config/initializers/stringex.rb+:

  Stringex::Localization.locale = :en

== CanCan Usage Note

You'll need to add a <tt>:find_by => :url</tt> to your <tt>load_and_authorize_resource</tt>.  Here's an example:

  load_and_authorize_resource :class => "Whatever", :message => "Not authorized", :find_by => :url

== Thanks & Acknowledgements

If it's not obvious, some of the code for ActsAsUrl is based on Rick Olsen's permalink_fu[http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/plugins/permalink_fu/] plugin. Unidecoder is a Ruby port of Sean Burke's Text::Unidecode[http://interglacial.com/~sburke/tpj/as_html/tpj22.html] module for Perl. And, finally, the bulk of strip_html_tags[link:classes/Stringex/StringExtensions.html#M000005] in StringExtensions was stolen from Tobias Lütke's Regex in Typo[http://typosphere.org/].
